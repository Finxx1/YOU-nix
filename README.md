# YOU-nix
An implementation of Unix various tools in the public domain
### Why?
Most Unix-like operating systems are closed source, such as Solaris or have restrictive licenses, like Gnu's Not Unix. While the Berkley Software Distribution and it's derivitives are licensed under a permissive license (BSD-2/3 Clause), there is not a whole Unix system that is public domain. This project is an attempt to change that. Everything in this repository is licensed under the Unlicense, a public-domain license for code.
### What about the kernel?
Maybe in the year 3000. Right now this code is just a replacement for common Unix tools like echo, pwd, pname, etc. I have not read past page 5 of OS Dev from 0 to 1 because I did not understand half the things I was expected to have mastered. Maybe a public-domain version of Linux or the BSD kernel may come out, but don't count on me making it.
